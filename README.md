# School Interview System

Language: English | [日本語](README-ja.md)

## Overview

This system is being developed to improve the efficiency and automation of the university's study
interviewing process.

### Purpose

✅ Efficiently identify students in need of assistance and reduce the burden on faculty.  
✅ Provide students with equal access to useful information and support.

## How this system works

### Environment

The client side of this system is developed in `Flutter`, so it is necessary to build a `Flutter`
development environment.  
For details,
see [client / README.md](https://github.com/school-interview/school-interview-system/blob/main/client/README.md#development-environment)

### Environment variable

You must create a `.env.local` file in the `backend` folder and set the environment variables.  
For details on what to set,
see [backend / README.me](https://github.com/school-interview/school-interview-system/blob/main/backend/README.md#prepare-envlocal-in-backend-directory)
